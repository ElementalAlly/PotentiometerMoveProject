# Welcome!

This is the site for the answers to the code of the Potentiometer Move Project in the robotics class.

To look at the code, click on the "PotentiometerMove.ino". There is a copy button in the top right if you want to just copy the code, but I suggest trying it yourself before getting the answer!
